		<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Introduction</h2>
		<p class="text-white/80">
			Digital Douglas ("we", "us", or "our"), based in the Cayman Islands, operates the LoomLetter
			mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the
			collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you
			have associated with that data.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="mb-8">
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Information Collection and Use</h2>
		<p class="text-white/80">
			We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve
			our Service to you.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="mb-8">
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Types of Data Collected</h2>

		<h3 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Email Address</h3>
		<p class="text-white/80">
			Each user is assigned a custom LoomLetter email address (e.g., example@read.loomletter.app).
			We securely store every newsletter sent to this email address, ensuring they are encrypted and
			accessible only through our app.
		</p>

		<h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Access and Refresh Tokens</h3>
		<p class="text-white/80">
			To enable inbox synchronization, we securely store access and refresh tokens in our database.
			These tokens allow our Service to periodically check your inbox and retrieve newsletters from
			the senders you have selected. The tokens are never exposed to the client and are managed
			entirely by the backend.
		</p>

		<h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-4 mb-2">Push Token</h3>
		<p class="text-white/80">
			We store a push token that is used to send push notifications to your device. These
			notifications alert you when new newsletters are available for you to read.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="mb-8">
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Data Processing</h2>
		<p class="text-white/80">
			Newsletters sent to your custom LoomLetter email address are securely stored and encrypted to
			protect your privacy. This ensures that your newsletters remain confidential and are only
			accessible through the app.
		</p>
		<p class="text-white/80">
			We generate an audio version of each newsletter for personal use only, which enhances your
			reading experience. This audio is stored temporarily within the app and cannot be downloaded
			for external use.
		</p>
		<p class="text-white/80">
			All newsletters can be accessed in various formats, including enhanced readability modes,
			which are intended solely for personal use.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="mb-8">
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Periodic Newsletter Checks</h2>
		<p class="text-white/80">
			To ensure you stay updated, our Service checks your inbox every 15 minutes to retrieve new
			newsletters. During the initial setup, we perform a one-time search that goes back as far as
			six months to discover past newsletters from the senders you have selected.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="mb-8">
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Legal Use of Audio and Readability Formats</h2>
		<p class="text-white/80">
			We provide text-to-speech (TTS) and enhanced readability formats to help users interact with
			their newsletters more easily. These features are for personal use only, and any
			redistribution, sharing, or external use of the generated audio or modified newsletter formats
			is not allowed. This ensures that we comply with copyright and content ownership laws, similar
			to services like Speechify.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="mb-8">
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Service Providers</h2>
		<p class="text-white/80">
			We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service
			Providers"), to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services, or to
			assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. These services may include but are not limited
			to:
		</p>
		<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-white/80">
			<li>Data processing and analysis</li>
			<li>Newsletter content summarization and enhancement</li>
			<li>Push notification services</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="text-white/80">
			These third parties have access to your personal data only to perform these tasks on our
			behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. For instance, we use
			OpenAI's ChatGPT to provide newsletter summaries and enhance content readability. All data
			processing is conducted under strict privacy and security protocols to ensure your data
			remains protected.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="mb-8">
		<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p class="text-white/80">
			We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by
			posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
		</p>
		<p class="text-white/80">
			You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this
			Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
